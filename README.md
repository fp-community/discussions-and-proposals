### Discussions

There are many `fp` libraries and interface and style are some diffrent.
We will discuss `how to make it better fp library` and implement it no matter what languages is like JS, Go, Ruby etc...

The issue section of this repository is open for anyone to propose a subject related to the FP library that deserves a discussion.

### Proposals

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to be proposed and championed to then enter the project.

It is inspired by the [React RFC repo](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs), but today we don't expect for every substantial change to go through this process; however, we hope that this brings more awareness to the community.
